##Experience
<p>I really enjoyed working with WordPress and its plugins. Even though it was first time using WordPress, I was 
comfortable navigating around the WordPress CMS. It was interesting to see how handy the WordPress works and how users can
customize it to match their needs. The hierarchy concenpt of WordPress was confusing at fist, but as I was developing, 
I was able to understand it. I look forward to use more of WordPress in the future.</p>
